## REACT

This is the React part of my thesis. It performs encryption and decryption of a given dataset using implementations of a number of selected cryptographic algorithms and measures the performance of said algorithms. 

## Usage

This application is developed using node.js and NPM and as such requires these frameworks to be installed. 

This application also requires some initial setup, you need to create an .env file containing certain configurations, among others an url pointing towards an active instance of the DATA-GATHERER application. See the .env.example for more information.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Installs all dependencies. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
